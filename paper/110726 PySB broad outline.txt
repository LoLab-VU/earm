== Introduction ==

Models are useful, but the workflow has problems/challenges

1) biochemistry is wrong

Could build another model, but the model will continue to evolve

How do we make the process transparent and powerful?

2) Lumped proteins into classes, so can't be fed by molecular data

Current technical solutions proposed:

- Rules based modeling (bng, kappa)

- Higher levels on rules: little b, metakappa

== Results ==

1. Biological problem

Old topology vs. New topology

2. Problem with old ODE representation

Conversion of the old model into rulesâ€¦changes level of representation

Rules into macros reduces verbosity and changes level of representation to fit with biological understanding

3. Adding new elements of topology

Pysb -> Pysb

4. Calling mini-model

Not just easier to do--can actually see what's going on!

5. Show simulation data

6. Features

Added simulator, can do basic calibration, can export to other formats, can use kappa or bng, stochastic
