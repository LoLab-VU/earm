        <h2 id="a1">About the Journal</h2>
			<h4 id="a1.1">Aims and Scope</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">Systems biology is an integrative discipline 
that seeks to explain the properties and behaviour of complex biological
 systems in terms of their components and their interactions.</p>
        <p class="norm"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> is a peer-reviewed author-pays online journal that
publishes high-quality research in the fields of <span class="b">systems biology</span>, <span class="b">synthetic biology</span> and <span class="b">systems medicine</span>.
 The Editors select manuscripts based on their novelty and wide 
biological significance. Although the primary emphasis of the journal is
 on molecular components and their interactions, systems studies at the 
organ level may also be considered. Works describing large-scale 
datasets will be judged, in part, by the extent to which these datasets 
are integrated both with each other and with computational models, with 
the ultimate aim to better understand the dynamic and complex nature of 
living systems. Reports of new experimental methods will also be 
considered in the context of this policy.  </p>

        <p class="norm">Topics falling within the scope of the journal 
include, but are not limited to: integrative genome-scale biology, 
quantitative biology, computational biology, metabolic and regulatory 
networks, evolution of genomes and biological networks, clinical and 
translational systems biology, synthetic biology and genome-scale 
biological engineering.</p>

        <p class="norm"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> publishes research articles as full-length <span class="b">Articles</span> or short <span class="b">Reports</span>. The journal publishes also <span class="b">Reviews</span>, <span class="b">Perspectives</span>, <span class="b">News &amp; Views</span>, <span class="b">Correspondences</span> and <span class="b">Editorials</span>.</p>
	
		<h4 id="a1.2">Impact Factor</h4>
        <p class="follows-h4">The 2010 impact factor for <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> is 9.667, according to the Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports. </p>
		<p class="norm">The 2010 impact factor represents the number of 
citations in 2010 of papers published in 2008 and 2009, divided by the 
total number of papers published in this period. A more detailed 
explanation of impact factors appears on the <a href="http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/free/essays/impact_factor/">Thomson Reuters web site</a>.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="backtotop">Top<span class="hidden"> of page</span></a>
        <h2 id="a2">Editorial Policies</h2>

		<p class="norm">Submission of a manuscript implies that it reports 
unpublished work and that neither itself, nor parts of it, have been 
published or are under consideration for publication elsewhere. By 
submitting a manuscript to <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>,
 the authors guarantee that they have the appropriate authority from 
their employers and/or funding agencies to publish the work. Any related
 work under consideration, review, revision or accepted for publication 
elsewhere must accompany the submission if they are relevant to its 
scientific assessment.</p>
		
			<h4 id="a2.1">Authorship Guidelines</h4>

       <p class="follows-h4">Submission of a paper implies that all 
authors have seen and approved the manuscript and its contents, and that
 they are aware of the responsibilities connected to authorship. 
Signatures from all the authors are not required; it is the 
corresponding author’s responsibility to obtain agreement from all 
authors supporting the submission. All authors will be notified upon 
receipt of a new manuscript and upon acceptance of a manuscript, but the
 editorial office corresponds only with the Corresponding Author, whose 
responsibility it is to communicate with all other authors. </p>
	<p class="norm">The nature of every author’s contribution must be 
specified both in the manuscript submission system and in the manuscript
 under the heading ’Author Contributions’. </p>
	<p class="norm">Our authorship policies conform to international standards (see, for example, <a href="http://www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html">http://www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html</a>).</p>



        <h4 id="a2.2">Use of living organisms</h4>
        <p class="follows-h4">For Research Articles submitted to <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 reporting experiments on live vertebrates and/or higher invertebrates, 
the corresponding author must confirm that all experiments were 
performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The 
manuscript must include a statement in the Materials and Methods 
identifying the institutional and/or licensing committee approving the 
experiments, including any relevant details. For experiments involving 
human subjects, authors must identify the committee approving the 
experiments, and include with their submission a statement confirming 
that informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p>

		<h4 id="a2.3">Biosecurity</h4>
		 <p class="follows-h4"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 follows the recommendations formulated by the National Science Advisory
 Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) regarding the oversight of dual use life 
sciences research (<a href="http://oba.od.nih.gov/biosecurity/biosecurity_documents.html">http://oba.od.nih.gov/biosecurity/biosecurity_documents.html</a>).</p>

		<h4 id="a2.4">Availability of published material data</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">It is understood that by publishing their work in <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>,
 authors agree to the disclosure of their findings and the release of 
their data, reagents and methods to enable colleagues in academic 
research to verify, reproduce and build on the published work. Materials
 must be made available at a reasonable cost that reflects production 
and distribution. The distribution of published materials does not 
automatically confer a right of co-authorship. The guidelines below were
 inspired, in part, by the recommendations formulated by the Board on 
Life Sciences from the National Academies Sharing Publication-Related 
Data and Materials: <a href="http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309088593">Responsibilities of Authorship in the Life Sciences</a> (National Academies Press, 2003).</p>
       <ul>
 	 	<li>Organisms, viruses, cells, nucleic acids, antibodies, and other 
reagents that were used in the research reported and that are not 
available from commercial suppliers should be freely available to 
colleagues in academic research. Human patient samples and data should 
be made available in accordance with the relevant ethical standards. </li>
 		 <li>Datasets obtained by experimentation, computation or data 
mining, should be made freely available, without restriction. This holds
 without exception to data that are central and integral to the findings
 reported in the paper and it is strongly recommended for any remaining 
associated data.</li>
 		 <li>Software should be described in sufficient detail to allow 
reproduction of the underlying algorithms by others. This may be 
achieved by providing the appropriate narrative or mathematical 
description, pseudocode and, possibly but not obligatorily, the source 
code. If a specific implementation is the focus of the study, it is 
strongly recommended that non-commercial users are granted free access 
to this implementation.</li>
 	 	<li>If a piece of software is central to the study, it is strongly 
recommended that it provides appropriate mechanisms (eg data import and 
export functionalities) for a reasonable integration in other workflows.</li>
 	 	<li>Any restrictions on the availability or on the use of included 
data, software and databases should be clearly specified in the paper. 
These restrictions may detract from the overall impact of a study, in 
particular when datasets, software or databases are central to the 
findings reported, and, therefore, will be taken into account in the 
final editorial decision.  </li>
		</ul>
		<p class="norm"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 will only review and publish manuscripts if the authors agree to make 
all data that cannot be published in the journal itself (e.g. novel 
nucleotide sequences, structural data, or data from large-scale gene 
expression experiments) freely available, where possible, in an 
appropriate public database (detailed guidelines can be found <a href="#a3.5">below</a>). </p>

        <h4 id="a2.5">Conflicts of interest</h4>
        <p class="follows-h4">In the interests of transparency and to help editors and reviewers assess any potential bias, <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 requires authors of original research papers to declare any competing 
commercial interests in relation to the submitted work. It is difficult 
to specify a threshold at which a financial interest becomes 
significant, but as a practical guideline, we would suggest this to be 
any undeclared interest that could embarrass you were it to become 
publicly known. Referees and editors are also subject to Conflict of 
Interest regulations. </p>

        <h4 id="a2.6">Scientific Integrity</h4>
        <p class="follows-h4">The editorial staff of <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 is strongly committed to maintaining high standards of integrity of the
 published scientific record. The journal requests that authors take 
note of and adhere to guidelines established by the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services Office of Research Integrity (<a href="http://ori.dhhs.gov/">http://ori.dhhs.gov</a>).
 The journal will investigate suspected instances of scientific fraud, 
inappropriate image manipulation, plagiarism, duplicate publication and 
other cases that violate research ethics. Depending on the outcome of 
these investigations, the journal may opt to publish errata or 
corrigenda, or, in cases of serious scientific misconduct, either to ask
 authors to retract their paper, or to impose retraction on them. In 
such cases, the authors’ employers may also be contacted. As a matter of
 policy, the journal will collaborate with independent institutional 
investigations into misconduct and usually accept the outcome of such 
investigations.</p>
		<p class="norm">An erratum is notification of an important error made 
by the journal, whereas a corrigendum is notification of an important 
error made by the author(s). </p>
		<p class="norm">Refutations of articles published in <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 can be considered for the Correspondence section of the journal. Such 
correspondence will almost always include data to support the arguments 
of the correspondent. The original authors of that article will be 
offered the opportunity to respond side-by-side with the correspondence.
 Both pieces will be peer reviewed at the discretion of the editor and 
acceptance depends on the strength of the arguments raised as well as 
the importance of the matter to a general readership. Publication of the
 correspondence does not automatically entail publication of a response 
of the authors of the challenged research paper. After one round of 
correspondence, <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> will consider the matter closed and will not publish further exchanges.</p>

        <h4 id="a2.7">Data collection and presentation</h4>
        <p class="follows-h4">Presented data must represent the findings
 in a fair and accurate manner. This includes appropriate statistical 
analysis and image processing. For further details, please refer to 
these <a href="#a3.4.3">guidelines</a>. </p>
		<p class="norm">The Editors reserve the right to request original 
versions of figures and the source data that were used to assemble the 
figure from the authors of a paper under consideration, or of a paper 
already published in <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>.</p>

        <h4 id="a2.8">Originality and Plagiarism</h4>
        <p class="follows-h4">The editors require that any information 
published in the journal represents a substantially novel contribution 
to the scientific record. Any manuscript submitted to <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 should therefore not contain content that has been formally published 
in a peer reviewed journal or another citable form, whether in print or 
electronic. This includes websites, blogs and the news media. </p>

        <p class="norm">Subject to licensing restrictions, <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 considers manuscripts based on information that has been previously 
discussed by the authors at scientific conferences in the form of 
posters, talks, abstract books, meeting reports or webcasts. Manuscripts
 may be posted prior to submission on recognised pre-publication 
platforms dedicated to discussion among peers, such as preprint servers 
(e.g. <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> or <a href="http://precedings.nature.com/">Nature Precedings</a>).
 The details of the preprint server concerned and any accession numbers 
must be included in the cover letter accompanying submission of the 
manuscript. <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> will also consider manuscripts based on unpublished academic theses released in accordance with institutional rules. </p>
		<p class="norm">Any text, data, material, images, ideas or quotes 
should be attributed to the original source, even if it is by the same 
authors. If necessary, authors should seek permission to use the 
material from the copyright holder in accordance to licensing 
stipulations. <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>'s policies on attribution follow the standards set by the Associated Press (<a href="http://www.ap.org/newsvalues/index.html">www.ap.org/newsvalues/index.html</a>).
 It is at the discretion of the editors whether prior publication of 
such related material prevents subsequent publication in the journal. </p>
<p class="norm">Plagiarism includes both the theft or misappropriation 
of intellectual property and the substantial unattributed textual 
copying of another's work. <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 uses CrossCheck, a multi-publisher initiative to screen submitted 
content for plagiarism, to detect overlapping and similar text 
(including self-plagiarism) prior to publication. To find out more about
 CrossCheck visit <a href="http://www.crossref.org/crosscheck.html">http://www.crossref.org/crosscheck.html</a>.</p>

        <h4 id="a2.9">Embargo Policy</h4>
        <p class="follows-h4">The content of papers and any associated 
press releases is strictly embargoed until the official date of 
publication of a manuscript. Accepted contributions can be discussed 
with the media from one week before the publication date provided the 
journalist respects the embargo date. We will press release selected 
papers with summaries. Authors may arrange their own publicity, but must
 adhere to the embargo conditions. Further details can be provided by 
the editorial office (<a href="mailto:msb@embo.org">msb@embo.org</a>).</p>

		<h4 id="a2.10">Citation</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">Comprehensive and accurate citation of the 
relevant literature is essential. We require citation of the primary 
literature wherever appropriate. To enable this, we have removed any 
limits on the total number of references in the bibliography, and the 
reference list is no longer subject to manuscript length format 
requirements (for details, see <a href="#a3.2.2.10">below</a>).</p>

		<h4 id="a2.11">Editorial Process</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">All submissions are initially assessed by an 
Editor of the journal, and may also be seen by a Senior Editor or a 
member of the Advisory Editorial Board. Manuscripts judged by the 
editors to be of potential interest to our readers are sent out for 
formal peer review. The decision concerning publication, revision or 
rejection is taken by the Editor based on the reviewers' reports and 
recommendations. Papers may, however, be returned to authors without 
review if in the judgement of the Editors, they fall out of scope of the
 Journal, fail to meet the criteria of wide biological significance and 
novelty, or if they are considered too preliminary. Further information 
on the journal’s peer review process can be found in our <a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/about/referees.html">Guide for Referees</a>.</p>

		<p class="norm"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 makes the editorial process transparent for all accepted research 
manuscripts, by publishing as an online supplementary document (the Peer
 Review Process File) all correspondence between authors and the 
editorial office relevant to the decision process. This will include all
 referee comments directed to the authors, as well as the authors’ 
point-by-point responses. Internal communications and informal 
consultations between editors, editorial advisors or referees will 
remain excluded from these documents. </p>
		<p class="norm">Importantly, referee anonymity will be strictly maintained. </p>
		<p class="norm">Authors have the possibility to opt out of the transparent process at any stage prior to publication.</p>
		<p class="norm">To further facilitate transparency, <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 has removed the “Confidential Comments” field from our referee 
reporting forms. This is to ensure that the authors receive all 
information pertinent to the decision made on a manuscript. Referees 
should be aware that all comments will be transmitted to the authors and
 the other referees. Should there be any issues with the manuscript, in 
particular concerns about ethical standards, data integrity, 
biosecurity, or conflicts of an academic or commercial nature that need 
to be communicated directly and confidentially to the editor, this can 
be done by email (<a href="mailto:msb@embo.org">msb@embo.org</a>).</p>
 		<p class="norm">Please see the following editorial for more information on these policies: <a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v6/n1/full/msb201072.html">From bench to website</a></p>

		<h4 id="a2.12">Transfer policies</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> is editorially independent of its publishers NPG and of the other EMBO Scientific Publications.</p>

		<p class="norm">Authors can choose to transfer manuscripts rejected from <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> to any of the other three EMBO Publications (<a href="http://www.nature.com/emboj/"><span class="journalname">EMBO Journal</span></a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/embor/"><span class="journalname">EMBO reports</span></a>, <a href="http://www.embomolmed.org/"><span class="journalname">EMBO Molecular Medicine</span></a>)
 by following the instructions appended to the editorial decision 
letter. Manuscripts transferred post-review will automatically include 
the referees’ reports and identities, and the editors will aim to use 
these reports in arriving at a rapid decision. Editors may choose to 
seek additional advice from referees or editorial advisory board members
 in cases where this would enhance informed decision-making. </p>
		<p class="norm">As part of Nature Publishing Group (NPG), manuscripts 
can be transferred to or from any of the NPG Journals using the 
manuscript transfer service. Referee reports will be automatically 
transferred, but without the referee identities. The editors aim to use 
these reports in aiding rapid and informed decision making, but this 
will likely necessitate input from additional referees or advisors known
 to the journal. Guidelines on NPG transfer policies can be found <a href="http://www.nature.com/authors/author_resources/transfer_manuscripts.html">here</a>.</p>

		<h4 id="a3.1">General Guidelines for Submission</h4>

        <p class="follows-h4">The Editors reserve the right to return 
manuscripts that are not in accordance with the following instructions. 
However, manuscript will not be rejected out of hand for format reasons:
 while published manuscripts are expected to conform tightly to the 
following guidelines, this is not a requirement at first submission.</p>

        <p class="norm">Manuscripts must be written in clear and concise
 English and be intelligible to a broad readership. Prior to submission,
 authors may benefit from having their manuscript reviewed for clarity 
by colleagues and/or by using one of the many English language-editing 
services that are available.</p>

		<h4 id="a3.2">Original Research Articles</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> publishes original research in two main formats: Articles and Reports.</p>
		
			<h5 id="a3.2.1">Articles</h5>
			<p class="norm">Articles are full-length original research papers and should be divided into the following sections:</p>

				<ul class="norm">
				  <li>Title page</li>
 				  <li>Abstract</li>
				  <li>Introduction</li>
				  <li>Results</li>
				  <li>Discussion</li>
				  <li>Materials and methods</li>
				  <li>Acknowledgements</li>
				  <li>Author Contributions</li>
				  <li>Conflict of Interest</li>
				  <li>References</li>
				  <li>Figure legends</li>
				  <li>Figures</li>
				  <li>Tables</li>
				  <li>Supplementary information</li>
				</ul>

			<p class="norm">The total character count (including spaces) for an 
Article, excluding the Extended Synopsis, Methods section, tables and 
supplementary material, but including title page, abstract, figure 
legends and references should not exceed 60,000 characters (the exact 
character count to be stated on the title page). Articles typically have
 6-8 Figures. Manuscripts exceeding this limit at submission may be 
returned to the authors for amendment. Please consider including a 
Supplementary information section (see below) if your manuscript exceeds
 the above limitations (see <a href="#a3.4.6">below</a>).</p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2">Reports</h5>
			<p class="norm">Reports are short publications focusing on a 
particularly provocative and novel aspect of a study. Reports do not 
have a Synopsis, but they should have an Abstract phrased in terms that 
are comprehensible to readers outside the discipline. Results and 
Discussion sections can be combined. The remaining sections are 
organized as described above for Articles.</p>
			<p class="norm">The total character count (including spaces) for 
Reports, excluding the Methods section, tables and supplementary 
material, but including title page, abstract, figure legends and 
references should not exceed 22,000 characters (the exact character 
count to be stated on the title page). Reports have, in principle, a 
maximum of 3 Figures. Manuscripts exceeding this limit at submission may
 be returned to the authors for amendment. Please consider including a 
Supplementary information section (see below) if your manuscript exceeds
 the above limitations.</p>
			
				<h5 id="a3.2.2.1">Title Page</h5>
				<p class="norm">The title should be short and informative, and 
should not contain any abbreviations (for example, 
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition should not be abbreviated to EMT). 
However, commonly used gene or protein acronyms are acceptable. The 
total length of the title should not exceed 100 characters (including 
spaces). Serial titles are not accepted.</p>
				<p class="norm">The full name of each author should be given. 
Multiple first-authorships are acceptable and should be indicated. 
Numbers in superscript should be used to indicate the department, 
institution, city with postal code and country, for each author. Any 
changes of address may also be given in numbered footnotes. It is 
possible to name more than one author as the correspondent of a 
published article, although we will by default address all 
correspondence to the single author listed as Corresponding Author upon 
submission.</p>
				<p class="norm">Please provide a running title of no more than 50 characters including spaces.</p>
				<p class="norm">Up to five keywords, which may or may not appear in 
the title, should be given in alphabetical order, below the abstract, 
each separated by a slash (/).</p>
				<p class="norm">Subject Categories are used to structure the current and archived online content of <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>,
 and to help readers interested in particular areas of molecular biology
 find relevant information more easily. Authors should suggest 
appropriate Subject Categories for the submitted manuscript. One or two 
categories may be selected from the following list:</p>

				<ul calss="norm">
				  <li>Bioinformatics</li>
				  <li>Proteomics</li>
				  <li>Functional genomics</li>
				  <li>Structural genomics</li>

				</ul>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.2">Abstract</h5>
			<p class="norm">This should be a single paragraph not exceeding 175 
words. The Abstract should be comprehensible to readers before they have
 read the paper, and abbreviations should be avoided where possible (as 
for the title). Reference citations within the abstract are not 
permitted. The abstract should describe all key novel findings of the 
study.</p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.3">Introduction</h5>
			<p class="norm">The Introduction should be succinct and without 
subheadings. It should provide only the necessary background 
information, rather than comprise a comprehensive review of the field. 
Citation of the primary literature is required where appropriate (see 
section on <a href="#a2.10">Citations</a>). </p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.4">Results</h5>
			<p class="norm">The Results section, and associated figures, tables 
and supplementary information, must accurately describe the findings of 
the study. Figure order should follow the text. Detailed methodological 
descriptions should be restricted to the Materials and Methods section. 
‘Data not shown’ is not permitted (see <a href="#a3.2.3">below</a>): all significant data should be displayed in the main figures or supplementary information. </p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.5">Discussion</h5>
			<p class="norm">The Discussion should accurately interpret the 
results, but not be repetitive with the Results section. Authors are 
encouraged to discuss their work in the broader context. Related 
published data must be appropriately discussed and cited. Speculation is
 allowed but should be clearly labelled as such. </p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.6">Materials and methods</h5>
			<p class="norm">This section should contain sufficient detail so that
 all experimental procedures can be repeated by others, in conjunction 
with cited references. Reagents must be described in such a way as to 
allow readers to identify them unequivocally and/or reproduce them. For 
example, antibodies epitopes should be described and siRNA and other 
probe sequences must be provided. In cases where detailed methods cannot
 be described within the length limits of the article, additional 
Materials and Methods can be included as Supplementary Information. This
 additional information should, however, not be of immediate importance 
for the understanding of the manuscript, and it is not permissible to 
move the entire “Materials and methods” section into the online 
supplement.</p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.7">Acknowledgements</h5>
			<p class="norm">These should be placed at the end of the text and not
 in footnotes. Personal acknowledgements should precede those of 
institutions or agencies. Grant numbers are permissible. Dedications are
 discouraged.</p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.8">Author Contribution</h5>
			<p class="norm"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> requires a statement specifying the contributions of every author. Further details on authorship can be found <a href="#a2.1">here</a>.</p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.9">Conflict of Interest</h5>
			<p class="norm"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> requires a statement specifying whether or not the authors have a Conflict of Interest (see <a href="#a2.5">above</a> for details). In the case of a Conflict of Interest, this must be specified. </p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.10">References</h5>
			<p class="norm">As a matter of policy, <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 requires the citation of primary literature (over review articles) 
wherever appropriate. Authors are responsible for the accuracy of the 
references. Authors are responsible for ensuring that the related 
literature is accurately and comprehensively discussed and cited. Review
 articles should only be cited for general background information, the 
proposal of certain concepts or similar purposes, whereas primary 
research articles should preferentially be referenced to introduce the 
question being addressed or to support the conclusions and 
interpretations of the results. Articles in press can be cited with the 
explicit permission corresponding author of the study; the journal name 
has to be included and, where available, the Digital Object Identifier. 
Reference formatting information can be found <a href="#a3.4.5">here</a>.</p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.11">Figure Legends</h5>
			<p class="norm">Figure legends should contain sufficient information 
to allow the reader to follow the data presented without referring back 
to the text, but should not be redundant with the Results section. Each 
figure must contain a heading, and each panel a subheading. All symbols 
and abbreviations used in the figure must be defined, unless they are 
common abbreviations or have already been defined in the text. 
Experimental details should, where possible, be given in the Materials 
and Methods section, and not repeated in the figure legends. Legends 
should be limited to 350 words in length. </p>

			<h5 id="a3.2.2.12">Supplementary Information</h5>
			<p class="norm">Supplementary information is peer-reviewed material 
directly relevant to the conclusions of an article that cannot be 
included in the printed version owing to space or format constraints. It
 is posted on the journal’s web site and linked to the published 
article, and may consist of additional figures, movies or tables, as 
well as their accompanying legends. Rather than citing “data not shown”,
 such supporting material should be included in the Supplementary 
information. Supplementary Results and Discussion sections are not 
permitted.</p>
			<p class="norm">The printed article must be complete and 
self-explanatory without the supplementary information. Supplementary 
information should enhance, but not be essential to, a reader's 
understanding of the paper. While <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 encourages authors to supply additional, extensive descriptions of the 
materials and methods used in a study as supplementary information, it 
is not permissible to move the entire "Materials and methods" section 
(or any other section of the manuscript) into the online supplement.</p>
			<p class="norm">Please consult the detailed guidelines <a href="#a3.4.6">below</a> on how to format supplementary information files and how to refer to supplementary information in the body of the text.</p>

			
		<h5 id="a3.2.3">Unpublished Data</h5>
		<p class="norm"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
does not permit citation of “Data not shown.” All data referred to in 
the paper should be displayed in the main or supplementary figures. 
“Unpublished observations” may be referred to in exceptional cases, 
where these are data peripheral to the major message of the paper and 
are intended to form part of a future or separate study. Personal 
communications (Author name(s), personal communications) must be 
authorised in writing by those involved, and the authorisation sent to 
the editorial office at time of submission. Care should be taken that 
embargo policies are not contravened. References to manuscripts in 
preparation or submitted, but not yet accepted, should be cited in the 
text as (Author names(s), in preparation), and should not be included in
 the list of references. Copies of such manuscripts should be enclosed 
at submission for reviewing purposes where relevant, as should 
manuscripts in press, which should be cited in the reference list (see <a href="#a3.4.5">below</a>)</p>

		<h5 id="a3.2.4">Conventions and Abbreviations</h5>
		<p class="norm">In general, the journal follows conventions given in 
Scientific Style and Format: The CBE Manual for Authors, Editors and 
Publishers (1994) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 6th edn. 
Please follow Chemical Abstracts and its indexes for chemical names. For
 guidance in the use of biochemical terminology follow the 
recommendations issued by the IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on 
Biochemical Nomenclature. In general, genes and genotypes should be 
indicated in italics; proteins and phenotypes should not be italicized. </p>
		<p class="norm">Authors should use approved gene and gene product 
nomenclature and apply the italicization and capitalization formatting 
as appropriate for each organism’s standard nomenclature. Please consult
 the appropriate nomenclature databases for correct gene names and 
symbols. Some useful general resources are: Entrez Gene (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene</a>); UniProt (<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">http://www.uniprot.org/</a>). </p>
		<p class="norm">Try to restrict the use of abbreviations to SI symbols
 (standard units of measurements) and those recommended by the 
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Abbreviations
 should be defined in brackets after their first mention in the text, 
not in a list of abbreviations. SI symbols and symbols of chemical 
elements may be used without definition in the body of the paper. 
Abbreviations of standard biochemical compounds, e.g. ATP, DNA, 
nucleotides in nucleic acids, and amino acids in proteins, need not be 
defined. Common language abbreviations, such as e.g. or i.e., should not
 be used.</p>
		
		<h4 id="a3.3">Other article types</h4>

        <h4 id="a3.3.1">Reviews</h4>
        <p class="follows-h3">Review articles aim to provide accessible,
 authoritative overviews of a field or topic. Reviews should communicate
 a sense of enthusiasm, weaving background information with the latest 
advances, and placing both of these elements in the context of the rest 
of the field. The readership of <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 encompasses a wide range – from advanced undergraduate and graduate 
students to group leaders and professors. Technical terms and specialist
 jargon should be avoided or clearly defined.</p>

	    <p class="norm">Reviews are usually commissioned but can also be submitted. After submission, all articles are refereed.</p>
		<p class="norm">The main text should be about 5,000 words. References 
should be limited to ~100 for a long Review concentrating on significant
 original research papers.</p>


         <h4 id="a3.3.2">Perspectives</h4>
        <p class="follows-h4">Perspective papers provide a platform to 
expose hypotheses and concepts that open up new avenues in Systems and 
Synthetic Biology. A Perspective paper has a more focused scope than a 
Review in the sense that it may highlight the work of a single 
laboratory and may present a particular viewpoint on a field.</p>

        <p class="norm">This format can also accommodate proposals, in 
which existing knowledge is used to delineate the plan of an ambitious 
project that would provide decisive and novel insight in the fields of 
Systems and Synthetic Biology. The proposed goal has to be highly 
original and of broad interest to the community. A proposal should 
detail the various aspects of the project such as its objectives, main 
concrete steps and milestones, utility and implications while in 
development and after completion.</p>

        <p class="norm">Perspectives are usually commissioned but can also be submitted. After submission, all articles are refereed.</p>

       <p class="norm">The main text should be about 5,000 words. References should be limited to ~100.</p>

        <h4 id="a3.3.3">News &amp; Views</h4>
        <p class="follows-h3"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>’s
 News &amp; Views section provides a forum in which scientific news can 
be communicated to a wide audience spanning the varied disciplines 
covered in systems biology. News &amp; Views articles are short (usually
 800-900 words), and have as much in common with journalistic news 
reports as the formal scientific literature. They should therefore make 
clear the news and opinions being discussed, and communicate a sense of 
excitement, yet provide a critical evaluation of the research or 
approach concerned.</p>

      
        <h4 id="a3.3.4">Correspondence</h4>
        <p class="follows-h4">A Correspondence is a flexible format that
 may include anything of interest to the journal’s readers, from policy 
debates to announcements to ‘matters arising’ from research papers. A 
Correspondence may describe primary research data, but only one Figure 
and one Table are allowed. A Correspondence has no abstract and should 
be limited to 1000 words in principle. The number of references should 
not exceed 10 for either the Correspondence or its Reply. Supplementary 
information can in principle only be in the form of structured data or 
dataset files.</p>

        <p class="norm">Authors must submit a competing financial 
interests statement, which is printed only if they declare that they 
have competing interests. In cases where a Correspondence is critical of
 a previous research paper, the authors are normally given the option of
 publishing a brief reply. Criticism of opinions or other secondary 
matter does not involve an automatic right of reply.</p>

        <p class="norm">Refutations and commentaries on previously 
published articles are always peer reviewed. Other types of 
Correspondence may be peer reviewed at the editors' discretion.</p>

      
        
        <h4 id="a3.4">General Formatting Guidelines</h4>

        <h4 id="a3.4.1" class="follows-h4">Text</h4>
        <p class="norm">The Editorial Office will only accept text files in LaTeX (<a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/authors/msb_latex_files.zip">download template files</a>),
 RTF, or MS Word format. The final character count must be clearly 
indicated on the title page of the manuscript. Manuscripts that do not 
comply with the formatting guidelines, or exceed the length 
restrictions, may be returned to the authors for amendment.</p>

        <p class="norm">Please submit the full text (including figure legends, tables, and references) as a single MS Word or RTF file.</p>


        <h4 id="a3.4.2">Figures</h4>
        <p class="norm">Figures and supplementary figures should be presented in the order they are mentioned in the text.</p>

        <p class="norm">Figures should be labelled in consecutive Arabic
 numerals. The final size of figures will be between 82 mm and 172 mm 
wide on the printed page. Please bear this in mind when submitting your 
manuscript for review and allow for sufficient resolution at a suitable 
size.</p>
		<p class="norm">Figures divided into parts should be labelled with an 
upper-case, bold letter (Helvetica Font). Figures with several parts 
should also be in proportion, with consistently sized lettering so that 
the whole figure can be reduced by the same amount to the smallest size 
at which the essential details are visible. Use Courier font for 
sequence data and Symbol font for any symbols.</p>

		<p class="norm">All lettering should be done using standard fonts 
(Helvetica, Times, Symbol, Courier) and retained in a separate layer (if
 possible) so that the production team can adapt any labels to the 
Journal’s style if necessary. All fonts used for labelling the figures 
should also be embedded in the final files if the software package 
offers this option.</p>
		
		<p class="norm">Scale bars, rather than magnification factors, should 
be used, with the length of the bar defined in the legend rather than on
 the bar itself. In general, visual cues on the figure itself are 
preferred rather than verbal explanations (for example, ‘broken line’ or
 ‘filled black triangles’) in the legend.</p> 
		<p class="norm">When preparing figures of microscopy images, please 
note that we strongly encourage the use of colours that are suitable for
 colour-blind readers: for example, the use of magenta/green is 
preferred over red/green for 2-channel images.</p>
		<p class="norm">For publication, we use TIFF and EPS files in PC or 
Macintosh format, preferably from Photoshop or Illustrator software. We 
cannot accept Freehand, Canvas, CorelDRAW or MacDrawPro files. These 
files must be converted to postscript (eps) format. For any figures 
submitted in photoshop or tiff format we require layered files to be 
sent whereby all text, arrows or additional attributes are placed on 
individual layers within the file. For line art/charts/graphs we prefer 
to work with Adobe Illustrator AI or EPS files. We can also accept 
high-resolution PDF files. </p> 
		<p class="norm">Non-vector graphics should be preserved at high 
resolution: 300 dpi minimum at final size for greyscale or colour 
halftone images, and 1,000 dpi minimum for bitmap (b/w) artwork.</p>
		<p class="norm">Further information regarding the preparation of electronic figures is available in <a href="http://www.nature.com/aj/artworkguidelines.pdf">this document [PDF]</a>.</p>
		<p class="norm"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span> does not have colour charges for figures, and the authors are therefore welcome to submit full colour figures.</p>

		<h4 id="a3.4.3">Data presentation</h4>
		 <p class="norm">Figures must accurately reflect the results of the 
experiments. Appropriate controls, markers and scale bars should be 
included in all panels. Statistical tests must be clearly defined and 
appropriate to the data.</p>

		<p class="norm"><span class="i">Source data for figures</span><br><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 strongly encourages authors to upload the ‘source data’–for example, 
tables of individual numerical values and measurements–that were used to
 generate figures. These files are separate from the traditional 
supplementary information files and are submitted using the "figure 
source data" option in the tracking system. Source data are directly 
linked to specific figure panels so that interested readers can directly
 download the associated ‘source data’ (see, for example, &lt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/365zpej">http://tinyurl.com/365zpej</a>&gt;), for the purpose of alternative visualization, re-analysis or integration with other data.</p>
        
			<p class="norm">The data should at usable by readers who understand 
the topic of the paper and should, at minimum, allow users to redraw the
 figures using an alternative graphical representation. Data should be 
annotated to provide essential information values included, providing a 
clear link to the figure legends in the main paper. Additional 
formatting guidelines for 'source data' are available for <a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/authors/source-data.pdf">download [PDF]</a>.</p>

		<p class="norm"><span class="i">Image Processing</span><br>
Images submitted with a manuscript for review should be minimally 
processed (for instance, to add arrows to a micrograph). Authors should 
retain their unprocessed data and metadata files, as editors may request
 them to aid in manuscript evaluation. If unprocessed data are 
unavailable, manuscript evaluation may be stalled until the issue is 
resolved. All digitized images submitted with the final revision of the 
manuscript must be of high quality and have resolutions of at least 300 
dpi for colour, 600 dpi for greyscale and 1,200 dpi for line art.</p>

		<p class="norm">A certain degree of image processing is acceptable for
 publication (and for some experiments, fields and techniques is 
unavoidable), but the final image must correctly represent the original 
data and conform to community standards. The guidelines below will aid 
in accurate data presentation at the image processing level; authors 
must also take care to exercise prudence during data acquisition, where 
misrepresentation must equally be avoided. Where appropriate, 
manuscripts should include a Supplementary Methods section that 
describes for each figure the pertinent instrument settings, acquisition
 conditions and processing changes, as described in this guide.</p>

			<p class="norm">Authors should list all image acquisition tools and 
image processing software packages used. Authors should document key 
image-gathering settings and processing manipulations in the Methods.</p>

			<p class="norm">Images gathered at different times or from different 
locations should not be combined into a single image, unless it is 
stated that the resultant image is a product of time-averaged data or a 
time-lapse sequence. If juxtaposing images is essential, the borders 
should be clearly demarcated in the figure and described in the legend.</p>
			<p class="norm">The use of touch-up tools, such as cloning and 
healing tools in Photoshop, or any feature that deliberately obscures 
manipulations, is to be avoided.</p>
			
			<p class="norm">Processing (such as changing brightness and contrast)
 is appropriate only when it is applied equally across the entire image 
and is applied equally to controls. Contrast should not be adjusted so 
that data disappear. Excessive manipulations, such as processing to 
emphasize one region in the image at the expense of others (for example,
 through the use of a biased choice of threshold settings), is 
inappropriate, as is emphasizing experimental data relative to the 
control.</p>
			<p class="norm">When submitting revised final figures upon conditional acceptance, authors may be asked to submit original, unprocessed images.</p>

			<p class="norm"><span class="i">Electrophoretic gels and blots</span><br>Positive
 and negative controls, as well as molecular size markers, should be 
included on each gel and blot. For previously characterized antibodies, a
 citation must be provided. For antibodies less well characterized in 
the system under study, a detailed characterization that demonstrates 
not only the specificity of the antibody, but also the range of 
reactivity of the reagent in the assay, should be published as 
Supplementary Information. The display of cropped gels and blots in the 
main paper is permitted if it improves the clarity and conciseness of 
the presentation. Cropped gels in the paper must retain all important 
bands, and space (several band-widths) should be retained above and 
below the relevant band(s). Vertically sliced images that juxtapose 
lanes that were non-adjacent in the gel must have a clear separation or a
 black line delineating the boundary between the gels. Quantitative 
comparisons between samples on different gels/blots are discouraged; if 
this is unavoidable, the figure legend must state that the samples 
derive from the same experiment and that gels/blots were processed in 
parallel. Loading controls must be run on the same blot. High-contrast 
gels and blots are discouraged, as overexposure may mask additional 
bands. Authors should strive for exposures with gray backgrounds. 
Multiple exposures should be presented in supplementary information if 
high contrast is unavoidable. Immunoblots should be surrounded by a 
black line to indicate the borders of the blot, if the background is 
faint. For quantitative comparisons, appropriate reagents, controls and 
imaging methods with linear signal ranges should be used. </p>
			
			<p class="norm"><span class="i">Microscopy</span><br> Authors should 
be prepared to supply the editors with original data on request, at the 
resolution collected, from which their images were generated. Cells from
 multiple fields should not be juxtaposed in a single field; instead 
multiple supporting fields of cells should be shown as Supplementary 
Information. Specific guidelines: Adjustments should be applied to the 
entire image. Threshold manipulation, expansion or contraction of signal
 ranges and the altering of high signals should be avoided. If 
‘Pseudo-colouring’ and nonlinear adjustment (for example ‘gamma 
changes’) are used, this must be disclosed. Adjustments of individual 
colour channels are sometimes necessary on ‘merged’ images, but this 
should be noted in the figure legend. We encourage inclusion of the 
following with the final revised version of the manuscript for 
publication: In the Methods, specify the type of equipment 
(microscopes/objective lenses, cameras, detectors, filter model and 
batch number) and acquisition software used. Although we appreciate that
 there is some variation between instruments, equipment settings for 
critical measurements should also be listed. A Supplementary Methods 
section (or part of a larger Methods section) titled ‘equipment and 
settings’ should list for each image: acquisition information, including
 time and space resolution data (xyzt and pixel dimensions); image bit 
depth; experimental conditions such as temperature and imaging medium; 
and fluorochromes (excitation and emission wavelengths or ranges, 
filters, dichroic beamsplitters, if any). The display lookup table (LUT)
 and the quantitative map between the LUT and the bitmap should be 
provided, especially when rainbow pseudocolor is used. If the LUT is 
linear and covers the full range of the data, that should be stated. 
Processing software should be named and manipulations indicated (such as
 type of deconvolution, three-dimensional reconstructions, surface and 
volume rendering, ‘gamma changes’, filtering, thresholding and 
projection). Authors should state the measured resolution at which an 
image was acquired and any downstream processing or averaging that 
enhances the resolution of the image. </p> 
		
			<p class="norm"><span class="i">Statistical analysis</span><br> All 
statistical analyses performed in the work must be clearly described, 
including the name of the test performed and the number (n) of 
independent experiments underlying each analysis. Authors must justify 
the use of a particular test and explain whether their data conform to 
the assumptions of the tests. In particular:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>When using statistical methods based on the normal distribution
 authors should explain how they tested their data for normality. If the
 data do not meet the assumptions of the test, then a non-parametric 
alternative should be used.</li>
			  <li>When making multiple statistical comparisons on a single data 
set, authors should explain how they adjusted the alpha level to avoid 
an inflated Type I error rate, or they should select statistical tests 
appropriate for multiple groups.</li>
			  <li>For each experiment, the number of both technical and 
biological replicates should be clearly stated. Biological replicates 
are derived from independent experiments using separately obtained 
biological samples, while technical replicates are created by repeated 
measurements on the same biological sample. In general, technical 
replicates should be averaged before any statistical inference tests are
 performed.</li>
			  <li>In cases where n is small, appropriate statistical tests should be employed and justified in the text.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="norm">Graphs must include clearly labelled error bars for 
cases where more than two independent experiments have been performed 
(error bars should not be shown for technical replicates). For more 
information on the appropriate use of standard deviation, standard 
error, and confidence intervals please refer to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200611141">Cumming et al (2007)</a>.
 When n is small (n &lt; 5), we recommend that the individual data from 
each experiment be plotted alongside an error bar. Figure legends should
 contain a basic description of n, P, and any relevant statistical tests
 or error bars.</p>

		<h4 id="a3.4.4">Tables</h4>
		<p class="norm">Tables should be typed on separate sheets and numbered
 consecutively with Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV). Tables should be 
self-explanatory and include a brief descriptive title. Footnotes to 
tables indicated by lower-case superscript letters are acceptable, but 
they should not include extensive experimental detail.</p>
		
		<h4 id="a3.4.5">References</h4>
		<p class="norm">Only articles that have been published or that are 
accepted for publication at a named publication should be cited in the 
reference list. In the text of the manuscript, a reference should be 
cited by author and year of publication; no more than two authors may be
 cited per reference; ‘et al’ should be used if there are more than two 
authors (i.e. Smith &amp; Jones, 2003; Smith et al, 2000). Papers 
accepted for publication must be cited with the corresponding 
author&amp;7rsquo;s permission and should include title and all author 
names (or initials if any of the authors are co-authors of the present 
contribution), as well as either the DOI, if available, or the term ‘in 
press’. In the reference list, citations should be listed in 
alphabetical order and then chronologically, with the authors’ surnames 
and initials inverted; where there are more than 20 authors on a paper, 
the first 20 will be listed, followed by ‘et al.’. Publications by the 
same author(s) in the same year should be identified with a, b, c after 
the year of publication. The name of each journal should be abbreviated 
according to Index Medicus and italicized. References should therefore 
be listed (and will subsequently appear in print) as follows:</p>

		<h4 id="a3.4.6">Supplementary information</h4>
		<p class="norm">Supplementary Information including text, figures and 
small tables (less than 50 rows) should be combined into a single PDF 
file. This PDF file should be labeled "Supplementary Information" (not 
Supplementary Results or Supplementary Methods etc...) and should start 
with a Table Of Content that provides a clear and easy access to the 
several sections of supplementary information, as cited in the main 
text.</p>

should be cited as "Supplementary Figure 1", "Supplementary Figure 2", 
Supplementary Table 1", "Supplementary Table 2", etc..., throughout the 
text. Each figure legend should be written clearly beneath its figure.</p>

		<p class="norm">Large supplementary tables (more than 50 rows) should 
be submitted as MS Excel spreadsheet documents (.xls), tab-delimited 
text (.txt), comma-separated values (.csv) or as XML files (.xml).&nbsp;
 They should not be included in the Supplementary Information PDF file 
and should be submitted using the file type "dataset" to prevent 
automatic conversion into the PDF format.</p>

		<p class="norm">In addition, the following file fomats are accepted :</p>

			</ul>

        <p class="norm">File sizes must be as small as possible, so that
 they can be downloaded quickly. In general, the number of files should 
be limited to 10, individual files should not exceed 10MB, and the total
 amount of supplementary material should be less than 100MB. Please seek
 advice from the Editorial Office before sending files that exceed these
 limits to avoid delays in reviewing and publication.</p>
		
		<p class="norm">Supplementary information is not copy-edited, so 
authors should ensure that it is supplied ready for publication. It 
cannot be altered, nor new supplementary information added, after the 
paper has been accepted for publication. The absence of copy-editing of 
supplementary information also means that these files are not included 
with the proof for checking, but will appear on the journal's website 
exactly as submitted.</p>
		 
		 
		
		<h4 id="a3.5">Data deposition</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">Large-scale datasets, sequences, atomic 
coordinates and computational models should be deposited in one of the 
relevant public databases prior to submission (provided private access 
is available at the database) and authors should include accession codes
 in the Materials &amp; Methods section. The suggested wording for 
referring to accession identifiers in a manuscript is the following: 
“The [protein interaction | microarray | mass spectrometry ] data from 
this publication have been submitted to the [name of the database] 
database [URL] and assigned the identifier [accession | permalink | 
hashtag ].” If necessary, please include in the manuscript the relevant 
information (username and password) for confidential access by 
peer-reviewers.</p>
		<p class="norm">Data for which no suitable public database exists 
should be included, if possible, as dataset files in supplementary 
information. In cases where data can not be confidentially deposited in a
 public database, and is too large to be included in Supplementary 
Information, please contact the editorial office for advice on how to 
make these data available for refereeing purposes.</p>

		<h4 id="a3.5.1">Functional genomics data</h4>

		<h4 id="a3.5.4">Computational models</h4>
		<p class="norm">Computational models should be provided in a 
machine-readable form at submission stage to allow reviewers to 
reproduce the analysis and simulations performed in the study. When 
possible, standardize format (SBML, CellML) should be used instead of 
scripts (e.g. MATLAB). Authors are strongly encouraged to follow the 
MIRIAM guidelines (<a href="http://biomodels.net/miriam/">http://biomodels.net/miriam/</a>) and deposit their model in a public database such as Biomodels (<a href="http://biomodels.net/">http://biomodels.net/</a>) or JWS Online <a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/authors/%28http://jjj.mib.ac.uk/">(http://jjj.mib.ac.uk/</a>).</p>

		<h4 id="a3.5.6">Human clinical and genomic datasets</h4>
		<p class="norm">In general, <span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 encourages authors to provide access to genotype and clinical data with
 as few restrictions as possible while respecting their ethical 
obligations to the patients and relevant medical and legal issues. If 
practically possible and if it is compatible with the individual consent
 agreement used in the study, such data should be deposited in one of 
the major public access-controlled repository such as dbGAP (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap</a>) or EGA (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega</a>).</p>

		<p class="norm"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 accepts and follows the recommendations of the International Union of 
Crystallography (IUCr), with regard to the deposition and release of 
macromolecular structural data. These guidelines are set out in the 
article by the IUCr Commission on Biological Macromolecules in Acta 
Crystallographica (2000), D56, 2. In summary, they state that all 
publications must be accompanied by deposition of both the atomic 
coordinates and the structure-factor amplitudes in the appropriate 
database (<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">PDB</a> or <a href="http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/">NDB</a>).
 In the case of low-resolution structures for which only a chain trace 
is reported, a set of C alpha positions and structure-factor amplitudes 
may be sufficient.</p>
		
		<p class="norm">For NMR structures, data deposited should include 
resonance assignments, and all restraints used in structure 
determination (NOEs, spin-spin coupling constants, amide exchange rates,
 etc) and the derived atomic coordinates for both an individual 
structure and for a family of acceptable structures.</p>
		<p class="norm">Structures of biological macromolecules solved by electron microscopy must be submitted to the EMDB database at <a href="http://emdatabank.org/">http://emdatabank.org</a>.

		<h4 id="a4.1">Presubmission Enquiries</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">If you have already prepared a manuscript, 
please submit this&nbsp;via our online system as an article, rather than
 sending a presubmission enquiry.&nbsp;This allows the editors to make a
 more informed decision as to whether or not the manuscript is 
potentially appropriate for the journal. </p>
		
		<p class="norm">Presubmission can nevertheless be submitted to enquire
 whether a manuscript in preparation is likely to be of interest to the 
journal.&nbsp;Presubmission enquiries should be submitted via our online
 submission system (<a href="http://mts-msb.nature.com/"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">http://mts-msb.nature.com</span></a>) or by e-mail (<a href="mailto:msb@embo.org"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;">msb@embo.org</span></a>) and should minimally include a list of all authors, a cover letter and an abstract.</p>
		
		<h4 id="a4.2">How to Submit</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">We use an online manuscript submission and tracking system: <a href="http://mts-msb.nature.com/">http://mts-msb.nature.com</a></p>
		
		<p class="norm">In order to submit, you must have registered for an 
account. After this, please consult the following instructions for 
submission via our secure server. Please be sure that your browser is 
set to accept cookies. Our tracking system requires cookies for proper 
operation. </p>
		
		<p class="norm">For original submissions, you will need to upload a 
cover letter, a Word file of the text of the manuscript (including 
figure legends), and a PDF file containing all the figures. 
Alternatively, individual figure files can be uploaded separately but 
please note that this can be more time-consuming than a PDF submission. 
Additional supplementary files can also be uploaded when applicable 
(please refer to the section ‘Supplementary information’ <a href="#a3.4.6">above</a>).</p>
		<p class="norm">Once you have submitted your files and the conversion 
is in progress, it can take up to 30 minutes before the PDF, created in 
the conversion process, is ready for approval. Please contact the 
editorial office [<a href="mailto:msb@embo.org">msb@embo.org</a>] if the
 conversion engine takes longer than this. It is important to check the 
quality of the figures in the converted PDF before approving the 
submission. Please remember that your manuscript will not be submitted 
until you have approved the converted files.</p>
		<p class="norm">To avoid any unnecessary delays, please refer to the 
most current electronic formatting guidelines when preparing your 
manuscript for submission. Authors using computer systems with 
non-Western type encoding are strongly encouraged to eliminate all 
occurrences of non-standard fonts in both the manuscript and the 
figures. We suggest using only the fonts Times, Symbol, Courier and 
Helvetica.</p>
		<p class="norm">We will acknowledge receipt of a submitted manuscript 
by e-mail as soon as the quality check (appropriate manuscript format 
and image quality) has been completed. All further correspondence will 
also be by e-mail. Please ensure that your servers are set up to allow 
e-mails from the journal, and contact us if you do not receive an 
acknowledgement e-mail within a few days of submission.</p>

		<h4 id="a4.4">Submission of Revisions</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">When a manuscript is returned to authors for 
revision, the revised version should be submitted within three months of
 the authors’ receipt of the referee reports, unless another date is 
specified in the decision letter. Please contact the editor by the 
deadline in cases where extra time is required for revision. Additional 
time may be granted upon request at the Editors’ discretion, assuming 
the conceptual advance of the study stands (with regard to the current 
literature). As a matter of policy, we do not consider any competing 
manuscripts published during the specified revision period as negatively
 impacting on the conceptual advance presented by your study. However, 
we request that you contact the editor as soon as possible upon 
publication of any related work, to discuss how to proceed.</p>

		<p class="norm">Only a single round of revision is generally permitted.</p>
		
		<p class="norm">The initial decision letter on the original version of
 the manuscript provides a URL that should be used for submission of 
revised manuscripts. Please do not upload revisions as new submissions. </p>
		<p class="norm">Revisions should be accompanied by a point-by-point 
response to the referees’ comments as well as the editorial decision 
letter, in PDF or Word format. To facilitate the re-evaluation, we 
encourage authors to intercalate their response with the referee 
comments.</p>
		<p class="norm">In addition, the following items are required when submitting a revision:</p>

		<h4 id="a5.1">Proofs</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">Authors will be sent an e-mail with a link to 
ownload their proof. The PDF should be clearly annotated for necessary 
corrections and then returned by e-mail to <a href="mailto:MSBproofcorrections@nature.com">MSBproofcorrections@nature.com</a>.
 It is the authors’ responsibility to check that the final proof is 
accurate. In the interests of speed, corrections should be returned 
within 24 hours. Essential changes of an extensive nature may be made 
only by insertion of a ‘Note added in proof’, and only with the approval
 of the Editors. A charge will be made to authors who insist on 
extensive amendment within the text at the page proof stage. Excessive 
alterations may delay publication of the article.</p>
		
		<h4 id="a5.2">Press Embargo</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">When discussing unpublished data (including data
 in accepted papers not yet published) with the press, authors should 
take care not to break the journal embargo policy (see <a href="#a2.9">above</a> for details).</p>

		<h4 id="a5.3">Open Access and Charges</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4"><span class="journalname">Molecular Systems Biology</span>
 levies an article-processing charge of $3,900 per article accepted for 
publication (Research Articles, Reports, Reviews and Perspectives). 
Correspondences evaluated by reviewers are subject to a publication fee 
of $900. Correspondences that are not peer reviewed are subject to a 
reduced processing fee of $500.</p>
	
		<p class="norm">Commissioned articles are free of any publication charges.</p>
		<p class="norm">Upon acceptance of their manuscript authors of articles and reports should complete the charge payment form and <a href="http://mts-msb.nature.com/letters/msb_copyright.pdf">licence to publish</a>
 form and return to NPG's production department (fax number included on 
form). We will waive charges for corresponding authors covered by the 
Health Internetwork Access to Research Initiative (HINARI). In 
exceptional circumstances charges may be reduced for authors that can 
justify their claim that they are unable to bear the costs of 
publication. Queries about the modalities of payment of the 
article-processing charges should imperatively be addressed to the 
editorial office within 14 days upon receipt of the final decision 
letter.</p>
		
		<p class="norm">Processing of an accepted manuscript can only proceed once the charge payment form and <a href="http://mts-msb.nature.com/letters/msb_copyright.pdf">licence to publish</a> have been returned to Nature Publishing Group.</p>

		<p class="norm">The article is universally and freely accessible to 
all via the Internet, in an easily readable format and deposited 
immediately upon publication, without embargo, in an agreed format - 
current preference is XML with a declared DTD - in at least one widely 
and internationally recognized open access repository.</p>

		<h4 id="a5.4">Digital Object Identifier</h4>
		<p class="follows-h4">NPG assigns a unique digital object identifier 
(DOI) to every article it publishes. The DOI initiative is an 
international effort for electronic content identification and is guided
 by the International DOI Foundation, composed primarily of academic 
publishers and societies. The DOI appears on the title page of the 
article. It is assigned after the article has been accepted for 
publication and persists throughout the lifetime of the article. It is 
important to include the article’s DOI in the reference, as volume and 
page information is not always available for articles published online.</p>
