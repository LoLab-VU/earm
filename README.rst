Extrinsic Apoptosis Reaction Model

http://sorgerlab.github.com/earm

EARM is a family of models of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway written using the
Python modeling framework PySB. Model variants focus on exploring alternative
hypotheses for the mechanism of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization
(MOMP), controlled by the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
