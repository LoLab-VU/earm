Extrinsic Apoptosis Reaction Model (EARM)
==========================================

The Extrinsic Apoptosis Reaction Model, or EARM, is a family of models of the
extrinsic apoptosis pathway written using the Python software framework `PySB
<http://www.pysb.org>`_.  Model variants focus on exploring alternative
hypotheses for the mechanism of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization
(MOMP), controlled by the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
