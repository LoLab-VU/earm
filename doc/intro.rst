Introduction
============

What is EARM?
-------------

The Extrinsic Apoptosis Reaction Model version 2, or EARM 2.0 for short,
denotes `both` a novel model of the Bcl-2 protein family interactions, as well
as a family of previously published models of this protein family, all written
using the Python software framework PySB <TODO>.
(currently 15) different models, focusing on varying scope and reaction
topologies for the Bcl-2 family protein network regulating mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). These set of models includes

- Three new MOMP models of expanded scope that are unique to EARM 2.0;
- Five MOMP models of hypothetical reaction topologies previously
  described in Albeck et al. (2008) PLoS Biology, Figure 11;
- Six MOMP models drawn from three papers from the research group of Pingping
  Shen;
- One MOMP model focusing on Bad phosphorylation drawn from Howells et al.
  (2011), J. Theor. Biol.

Goals
-----

Our goals in creating EARM 2.0 were to:

- Create a newly updated model of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway incorporating
  current knowledge of Bcl-2 interactions and MOMP mechanism
- Demonstrate the use of PySB for transparent and reusable model development
- Make previous apoptosis modeling work (from our group and others') available
  to the research community in a common format
- Explore approaches for working with, and discriminating among, multiple
  hypotheses for biological mechanisms.
