Here are the excel sheets.  The page each one opens to is the data for 50ng/ml
trail plus cycloheximide.  The units are in overexpressed GFP-tagged proteins
per cell (Bax-GFP for example), so to get total Bax in that cell, you'd have to
add the average endogenous Bax to those numbers.  The Bid data are from Fig 4
of my nature paper, and the Bcl2 data will be in the simulation paper with
Suzanne.  BclxL and Bax are unpublished. 

Nomenclature:  the number in the "sheet" tab is the dose of trail - 100, 250,
50, 10, 2, and + means plus cycloheximide.  For example, 1000+ means 1000ng/ml
TRAIL plus cycloheximide.

You can find the endogenous levels of each of the 4 proteins in the
supplementary captions pdf.  The data to support these numbers is in the
supplementary figs pdf.
